## Arrays

In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object that is used to store a collection of values. These values can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, functions, and even other arrays.

Arrays are ordered, meaning that the elements have a specific position, or index, within the array, starting from 0 for the first element. This allows you to access and manipulate individual elements based on their index.

Here's an example of how you can create an array in 

## code 
```
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
``` 
In this example, myArray is an array containing five numbers.

You can access individual elements of an array using square brackets [] and the index of the element:  

## Length Of an Array

Arrays also have a property called length which indicates the number of elements in the array: 
```
let lengthOfArray = myArray.length; // This will be 5
```  

## Assigning a new value to specific Index  
You can also change the value of an element by assigning a new value to a specific index:
 
 ``` 
 myArray[2] = 10; // This will change the third element to 10
```


Arrays have many built-in methods like **push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), slice()**, and more, which allow you to perform various operations on the elements.

Keep in mind that JavaScript arrays are `dynamic`, meaning that you can change their size by adding or removing elements. They can hold a mix of different data types, which makes them very versatile for various programming tasks.


**Remaining methods of arrays are implemented in code files refer there**
